Goals for this project

Registration is a difficult problem for brains with cancers in them. For our purposes, we use rigid registration so that internal features of the brain are not messed up (ie tumor, resection cavity etc). Deformable registration offers some solutions if the internal features of the brain are preserved. There are multiple modules available that claim to be great at this.

There are two T1 files from different dates from one of our past studies. Attempt to register them to each other using deformable registration.
